## Overview

**LinkHive** solves the challenge of uneven traffic distribution in dynamic networks by leveraging SDN controllers to optimize routing, reduce congestion, and ensure reliable message delivery. It adapts to real-time traffic conditions and provides both network-level insights and application-level flexibility.

---

## Key Features

- **Centralized control:** SDN controller for smarter routing.
- **Dynamic load balancing:** Evenly distributes traffic across network nodes in real time.
- **Traffic monitoring:** Real-time decision making and analytics.
- **Modular design:** Integrates with Kafka or other message brokers.
- **Scalable architecture:** Ideal for testing distributed applications.
- **Extensible:** Easy for research, education, or adding new features.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Bash scripts
- **Frameworks/Tools:**  
  - Mininet (network emulation)
  - Ryu or ONOS (SDN controller)
  - Docker (optional)
  - Kafka (optional for messaging)

**Architecture Choices:**
- SDN-based separation of control and data plane
- Load balancing logic embedded in controller
- Optional event streaming with Kafka

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Mininet installed
- SDN controller (Ryu / ONOS)
- *(Optional)* Apache Kafka + Zookeeper for message streaming

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamserAliKhan/LinkHive.git
cd LinkHive

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Mininet topology (example: single topology with 3 nodes)
sudo mn --topo single,3 --controller=remote

# Run the SDN controller logic
python controller.py
```

---

## Usage

Users primarily interact via CLI and controller logs.

**Example flow:**
1. Launch Mininet topology.
2. Start controller script (with load balancing enabled).
3. Generate traffic using `iperf` or custom packets.
4. Monitor traffic distribution and balancing.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (examples)

- `KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092` (if Kafka used)
- `TOPOLOGY_SIZE=5` (custom topology size)

### Customization

- Edit `config.yaml` to adjust topology, controller logic, or broker setup.

## Demo

A live deployment is coming soon!  
Meanwhile, you can request a screen-recorded demo video from the author.

---

## Screenshots

*Visuals (CLI output, topology diagrams, dashboards) will be added soon.*

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

**Workflow:**
- Fork → Branch → Pull Request

## FAQ

**Q: Why use SDN instead of static routing?**  
A: SDN allows for real-time, adaptive network management, which is essential for dynamic and scalable distributed systems.

**Q: Can I run LinkHive without Kafka?**  
A: Yes, Kafka is optional and only needed for event/message streaming use cases.

**Q: What SDN controllers are supported?**  
A: Currently, Ryu and ONOS are supported. Others can be integrated with minor changes.

**Q: How do I visualize traffic distribution?**  
A: Visualization features are planned. For now, monitor via CLI logs or use Mininet’s built-in tools.

**Q: How can I contribute a new load balancing strategy?**  
A: Fork the repo, implement your logic in the controller module, and submit a PR!
